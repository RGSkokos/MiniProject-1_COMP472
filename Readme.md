#### STEP 2: USE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK TO RUN THE CODE  
Once these files are in the same folder as the **MinProj1_COMP472**  jupyter notebook file, you can proceed to the next step.
When running this file, in Jupyter Notebook, simply click on **"Kernel" + "Restart & Run All"** in order to run each cell one after the other.
Cosidering the size of the file being around 4GB, this will take some time to run.

#### STEP 3: PERFORMANCE FILE

**DO NOT OPEN THE TEXT FILE UNLESS ALL CELLS HAVE BEEN RUN FROM START TO FINISH.**

ALL DONE :)
